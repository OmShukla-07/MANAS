# 🚨 Railway DNS Troubleshooting - Step by Step

## 🔍 **Check These in Railway Dashboard:**

### **Step 1: Verify Domain Generation**
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Look for **"Domains"** or **"Networking"** tab
3. **What do you see?**
   - [ ] A URL like `manas-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`
   - [ ] "Generate Domain" button
   - [ ] Nothing/empty

### **Step 2: Check Service Status**
1. In Railway dashboard, look at your service
2. **Status should show:**
   - [ ] 🟢 "Active" or "Healthy"
   - [ ] 🔴 "Failed" or "Error"
   - [ ] 🟡 "Building" or "Deploying"

### **Step 3: Check Latest Logs**
Look for these in Railway logs:
```
✅ GOOD: [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
✅ GOOD: [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080
✅ GOOD: [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 6
❌ BAD: Any ERROR messages after gunicorn starts
```

## 🛠️ **Common DNS Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: No Domain Generated**
**Solution:** Click "Generate Domain" in Railway dashboard

### **Issue 2: Wrong Port Configuration**
Check Railway variables:
- `PORT=8080` (must be 8080, not 8000)

### **Issue 3: ALLOWED_HOSTS Missing Railway Domain**
Add to Railway variables:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,.up.railway.app,.railway.app
```

### **Issue 4: Service Not Actually Running**
Even if logs show "started", check if requests are being handled

## 🧪 **Alternative Testing Methods:**

### **Method 1: Use Railway CLI (if available)**
```bash
railway status
railway domain
```

### **Method 2: Check with Different Tools**
- Try incognito/private browser window
- Try different device/network
- Use online DNS checker: https://www.whatsmydns.net/

### **Method 3: Direct IP Access (Advanced)**
Railway might provide direct IP access in some cases

## 📋 **What to Check Right Now:**

1. **Railway Dashboard → Your Project**
2. **Look for "Domains" section**
3. **Copy the EXACT URL shown**
4. **Check if there's a "Generate Domain" button**
5. **Verify service status is "Active/Healthy"**

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working:**

The issue might be:
- Railway region/server issues
- Account limitations
- Service not properly bound to port 8080
- Environment variables not properly set

**Please check your Railway dashboard and tell me:**
1. What URL is shown in the Domains section?
2. What's the service status?
3. Are there any error messages in the latest logs?
