# MANAS AI Fix Summary ✅

## Issue Resolved
The MANAS AI system was not working due to an **incorrect Gemini model name**.

## Root Cause
- The code was using `gemini-1.5-flash` which is no longer available
- This caused all AI responses to return fallback error messages

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated Model Name**: Changed from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.5-flash`
2. **File Modified**: `chat/manas_ai_service.py`
3. **Line Changed**: Line 44 - Updated GenerativeModel initialization

## What's Working Now ✅
- **Session Creation**: All three companions (Arjun 📚, Priya 💝, Vikram 🆘)
- **AI Responses**: Real, contextual responses from Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Companion Personalities**: Each companion responds with their unique personality
- **Web Interface**: Browser interface working at http://127.0.0.1:8000/student/manas-ai/
- **API Endpoints**: All REST API endpoints functional
