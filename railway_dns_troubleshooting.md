# üö® Railway DNS/Domain Issue Troubleshooting

## Problem
- ‚úÖ Deployment successful on Railway
- ‚úÖ Application running (gunicorn started)
- ‚ùå "DNS not found" error when accessing URL

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Railway Domain Not Generated Yet**
Sometimes Railway takes time to generate the public domain.

**Check:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project
2. Look for "Domains" or "Networking" section
3. Check if a `.railway.app` domain is listed
4. If not, click "Generate Domain" or "Add Domain"

### 2. **Wrong Domain URL**
Let's verify the correct Railway URL:

**Expected format:** `https://[service-name]-production-[hash].up.railway.app`

**From your deployment, it should be:**
`https://manas-production-7ee4.up.railway.app`

### 3. **Port Configuration Issue**
Railway might not be mapping the port correctly.

**Solution:**
1. Go to Railway Settings
2. Check "Service" settings
3. Verify PORT environment variable is set to 8080
4. Or add PORT=8080 in Variables if missing

### 4. **Railway Service Not Public**
The service might not be exposed to public.

**Check:**
1. In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Settings
2. Look for "Public Networking" or "Domains"
3. Ensure public access is enabled

### 5. **DNS Propagation Delay**
Sometimes DNS takes time to propagate.

**Try these alternatives:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes and try again
- Try from different browser/incognito mode
- Try from mobile data instead of WiFi
- Use different DNS (8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1)

## Immediate Steps

### Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Look for "Deployments" tab
3. Check latest deployment status
4. Look for any domain/URL listed

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `PORT=8080`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` includes your Railway domain

### Step 3: Check Railway Logs
1. Go to "Deployments" ‚Üí Latest deployment
2. Check for any error messages after gunicorn starts
3. Look for any port binding issues

### Step 4: Try Alternative URLs
Sometimes Railway generates multiple URLs:
- Check Railway dashboard for exact URL
- Try with/without 'www'
- Try HTTP vs HTTPS

## If Still Not Working

We might need to:
1. Check Railway service configuration
2. Add proper ALLOWED_HOSTS setting
3. Verify Railway domain generation
4. Check for any firewall/network restrictions

## Next Action Required
**Please check your Railway dashboard and tell me:**
1. What URL is shown in the "Domains" section?
2. Is there a "Generate Domain" button you need to click?
3. What does the latest deployment log show after gunicorn starts?
